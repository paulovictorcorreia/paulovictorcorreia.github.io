## Introduction

Hello there! My name is Paulo Victor Queiroz Correia, I'm a student of computer engineering in Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte(UFRN), and I am fascinated for programming, knowledge and, of course, Brazilian Popular Music.

This website was created with the intention of showing to the world the work I develop, both as student and professional, and, with that, step by step, begin to conquer the whole world! 
### Projects

For this website, we're going to present a quick preview of the work, and then send you to another page with all the information of the specified project.

#### Digital Image Processing (in development)
This project was made in collab with student Luiz Carlos Abbott Galv√£o for the course of Digital Image Processing, instructed by Professor [Agostinho Brito Jr.](http://agostinhobritojr.github.io/). The course is given in modules, and in each module we were given an activity related to the subject, such as inverting colors of set of pixels to using Canny lines. You can access this project through [here](https://paulovictorcorreia.github.io/Digital-Image-Processing/).

#### Tic Tac Toe with Min Max
For this project, we developed a javascript code with framework _p5.j_  of a Tic Tac Toe game, using min-max algorithm, in which we minimize our opponents chance of victory and maximize our's. You can access the page clicking [here](https://paulovictorcorreia.github.io/tictactoe/).
